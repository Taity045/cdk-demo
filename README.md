# BUILDING AND ECS CLUSTER WITH CDK

Welcome to the repository for the article **A Beginner's Guide to CDK: Building an ECS Cluster** [I wrote here](https://tatenda.hashnode.dev/a-beginners-guide-to-cdk-by-building-an-ecs-cluster). This repository contains code examples and resources related to the article.

## Overview

In this article, you'll learn the essentials of AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) by creating an Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster. The guide covers fundamental CDK concepts and provides a step-by-step walkthrough to build and deploy an ECS cluster using CDK. Whether you're new to CDK or want to explore ECS deployment using this technology, this guide is designed to help you get started.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

In

~$ npm i -g aws-cdk

Installing or updating AWS CDK CLI with npm (requires Node.js â‰¥ 10.3.0):

You probably wondering why we're installing npm when I said we'll be building with Python, this is because [CDK Construct Library](https://constructs.dev/) is developed in TypeScript and runs on Node.js thus we require npm.

- Basic knowledge of AWS services, ECS, and containerization concepts.
- Familiarity with programming languages (specifically TypeScript or Python, depending on the examples provided).
